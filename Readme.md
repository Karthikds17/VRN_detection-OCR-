Road traffic accidents have always been a serious issue in modern society. 
According to statistical results, more than 90% of accidents have been caused by a driverâ€™s mistake and/or fatigue. 
Vehicle detection and tracking applications play an important role for civilian and military applications such as in highway traffic surveillance control, 
management, and urban traffic planning. Vehicle detection process on road is used for vehicle tracking, counts, average speed of each individual vehicle, 
traffic analysis and vehicle categorizing objectives and may be implemented under different environments changes.  

In such a situation, detecting a Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) would play a major role is resolving issues. 
For this we use image processing methods along with OCR to extract the number plate text which could be later used for further investigation 

Some other applications of using this detection would help in identifying stolen cars, calculating fees for parking, 
invoice tools or for providing access control to safety zones. 

Was were able to minimize the validation loss to 4.82 at epoch 69 using our CNN+RNN+CTC model which performed way better than Tesseract and EasyOCR. 
Performed image processing to clean the images, used OCR techniques to extract text and conducted exploratory analysis specific to accuracy, 
character matches/missed, standard deviation etc. This model will help if it is a labelled dataset.
